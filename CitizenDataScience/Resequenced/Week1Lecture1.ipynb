    "To see the world in the way a data scientist sees it requires you to put on a new pair of spectacles. Through these spectacles, any characteristic you are interested in - whether that be height, petal width, loudness, sadness, sex or the number of piano tuners in Ireland - is a **variable**. Sometimes these are better known as **attributes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a variable as a set of potential values. Height, width and loudness are physical and numerical, **continuous** variable that may take up infinitely many values while sadness may be measured on a scale of 1 to 5 (it is **discrete**). Sex is not numerical but **categorical** - either \"male\" or \"female\" - but the number of piano tuners is, since it can be any integer above 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Look around you and choose 5 characteristics. What kind of variables are they? Numerical or categorical? Discrete or continuous? \n",
    "\n",
    "When programming with Python, whenever we bring a new quantity into play and store that into memory, we call the label of that value a **variable** too, since it may later on take on a new value. So for example, we may write *nr_of_piano_tuners = 87*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we speak of variables, we probably mean the statistical kind, but there is one distinction important to keep in mind when working with variables in Python. Whenever we work with categorical variables, we need to store them as **strings**, by enclosing them with quotation marks. So for example, we could write *sex = \"female\"*. \n",

    "Data ultimately consists of variable-values. For example, you may have a list of the heights of all people in your class, a list of loudness estimates from football matches, a list of member of parliament members... All of these are **raw data**, because they list individual observations where each has a value out of the possible variable values.\n",
